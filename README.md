‚úÖ What Is This Project About?
This project is a sales trend analysis using SQL. You‚Äôre working with an e-commerce dataset (online_sales_orders.csv) that contains over 600 rows of order data, including:

Order date

Product ID

Your goal is to analyze the sales data and answer business questions like:

How much money did we make each month?

How many orders were placed?

What are the top-selling months?

Which product categories earn the most?

What payment methods are most used?

üìà What You Did (Steps)
Explored the dataset using simple SQL queries (like SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)

Grouped the data by month and year to calculate:

Monthly revenue (SUM(amount))

Monthly order volume (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id))

Used SQL aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), EXTRACT() to analyze data over time.

Identified trends, like:

Best months by revenue

Most popular product categories

Most used payment methods

Wrote SQL queries to answer common interview-style questions.
